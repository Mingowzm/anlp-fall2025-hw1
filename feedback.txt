This assignment was super rewarding since it walked me through the LLaMA architecture. I had a rough idea before, but this time I got to really dig into the details of the implementation. The first part felt pretty straightforward, just filling in the missing pieces. The second part was more fun and challenging because I had the freedom to try my own ideas to improve the baseline. Overall, I really enjoyed it â€” definitely an awesome assignment.
